The session covered essential aspects of effective communication, from the art of storytelling and structuring speeches, to delivering them.",
            storytellingTitle: "The Art of Storytelling",
            storytellingContent: "Storytelling is a subtle skill that involves more than just relaying events. She underlined the significance of engaging the audience's emotions, engrossing them in the story, and forging a bond. Understanding the audience's demographics and interests is the first step in crafting a tale that will speak to their experiences, worldviews, or aspirations. The story comes alive when relatable characters, striking imagery, and intense conflicts are present. This has a significant effect on the listeners.",
            structuringTitle: "Structuring Your Speech",
            structuringContent: "A well-structured speech is akin to a well-designed buildingâ€”it has a strong foundation and a logical flow.  The introduction sets the tone, grabbing the audience's attention with a compelling hook or a thought-provoking question. The body of the speech elaborates on the key points, employing a coherent and organized structure. Each point should seamlessly transition into the next, guiding the audience through the storyline. Finally, the conclusion should summarize the speech's essence, leaving a memorable impression and potentially inciting action or contemplation.",

            deliveringContent: "Your first 40 seconds of a speech are crucial to captivating your audience. During this vital time, delivery is key.  Eye contact connects you with the audience and draws them into your story. Sincere, well-placed gazes express confidence, genuineness, and rapport.",
            deliveringPoints: [
                "In combination with captivating eye contact, body language is dynamic. Your posture, gestures, and facial emotions should support your statements, magnifying them. The appropriate body language emphasises essential themes, shows excitement, and makes your speech memorable.",
                "The melody that complements the text is vocal variety. Like a story, your voice should change pitch, tempo, and loudness to keep listeners engaged. Different vocal tones offer depth, emotion, and emphasis, making even an average speech compelling.",

            findingStoriesTitle: "Where to Find Stories",
            findingStoriesContent: "To find interesting stories, you have to be a good observer and understand what people go through. Stories can come from many different places, like your own life, books, history, or even the lives of your friends and family. Everyday events can be turned into interesting stories that make people feel something. The key is to find the emotional or familiar parts of the story and tell them in a way that makes people want to listen.",

Gavel Mora's evaluation criteria encompass a holistic view of a speech.  Content is evaluated for its relevance, depth, and originality. The organisation is assessed to ensure a clear structure and effective transitions. Delivery focuses on the speaker's presence, charisma, and connection with the audience. Language evaluates the choice of words, grammar, and overall articulation. Lastly, overall impact assesses how well the speech achieves its intended purpose and resonates with the audience.",
